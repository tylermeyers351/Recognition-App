## Summary

After years of logging notes on the Notes app or Google Sheets on my phone, I wanted to create a customized and simple design to record some of the ideas that pop into my head when thinking about anything related to fitness. In my view, most apps on the market were too complicated for what I wanted, so I intended to create an app that I can quickly log a note, or access one through specific categories.

So, this is it. I created a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to be used on my phone (or desktop), wherever I am. It leverages Firebase as its server and backend infrastructure for various functionalities. Firebase is a cloud-based platform that provides services such as a real-time database, authentication, and more. Bootstrap was used for styling.

## Learning goals  

To practice programming with JavaScript, utilizing the Firebase Realtime Database, and styling with Bootstrap.
