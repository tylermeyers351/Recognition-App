# Workout-Notes-App

Project completion: October 2023  

## Summary

After years of using the Notes app on my phone or Google Sheets, I wanted to create a customized and simple design to record some of the ideas that pop into my head when thinking about anything related to fitness. I'm always learning, and I never know when an idea will pop into my head. In my view, most apps on the market were way to complicated for what I wanted, so I wanted something that I can quickly log a note, or access one.

So, this is it. I created a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to be used on my phone, wherever I am. It leverages Firebase as its server and backend infrastructure for various functionalities. Firebase is a cloud-based platform that provides services such as real-time database, authentication, and more.

Visit here to see the app at https://workout-notes.netlify.app/. It's desktop friendly, but built to be used as a PWA on mobile. Currently only read-only because I actually use this!
